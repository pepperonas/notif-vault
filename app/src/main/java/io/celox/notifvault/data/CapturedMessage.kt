/**
 * A single captured message. The [id] is a content hash so that WhatsApp re-posting
 * the same message inside many MessagingStyle notifications results in exactly one row
 * (insert uses IGNORE on conflict). That is the whole de-duplication trick.
 *
 * Chats are grouped by [conversationKey] — a *stable* per-chat identifier taken from the
 * notification (shortcut id / tag), NOT by the human-readable [conversation] title. The
 * title is often null for 1:1 WhatsApp chats and occasionally missing for groups, so
 * grouping by the title mixes distinct chats and splits groups by sender. The key stays
 * constant for a chat even when its displayed title changes.
