// v2 introduced the stable CapturedMessage.conversationKey used for grouping. There is no
// 1→2 migration on purpose: the old rows were grouped by the unreliable title, so we took a
// clean slate (destructive fallback from v1 only) and let every chat re-populate with a
// proper stable key. v3 reworks the indexes (composite conversationKey+packageName+messageTime)
// via a real, data-preserving MIGRATION_2_3 in DatabaseProvider. Schema JSON is exported to
// app/schemas as the reference for hand-written migrations.
